# Traffic Sign Classification using CNN

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in Python using TensorFlow and Keras to recognize and classify traffic signs. By training the model on a dataset of traffic sign images, we can achieve accurate predictions.

## Dataset
- The dataset contains 58 classes of traffic signs.
- Each class corresponds to a specific type of sign (e.g., stop sign, speed limit, yield sign).

## Requirements
- Python 3
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Matplotlib
- NumPy

## Usage
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Extract the dataset (zip file) and organize it into appropriate folders.
4. Train the CNN model using the provided code.
5. Evaluate the model's performance and fine-tune hyperparameters if needed.

## Model Architecture
- Input layer: Convolutional layers to extract features.
- Hidden layers: Stacked convolutional and pooling layers.
- Output layer: Dense layer with softmax activation for classification.
